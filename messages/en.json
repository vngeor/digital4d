        "description": "Innovations in 3D Printing in 2026 revolutionize manufacturing with AI, multi-materials, and bioprinting. They reduce waste, speed up production, and open new applications in medicine and automotive. AI and Automation AI automatically optimizes designs for strength and efficiency, while IoT sensors predict maintenance. Robots manage the entire process from design to post-processing, reducing time by 50%. Multi-Material Printing New printers like AtomForm Palette 300 with 12 nozzles combine up to 36 colors or materials (metals+polymers) in one object, saving 90% filament. Bioprinting and Medicine Bioprinters create tissues and custom implants, moving from labs to clinics. 4D Printing and Sustainable Materials Materials that change shape under stimuli (heat/light) for self-assembling parts",
